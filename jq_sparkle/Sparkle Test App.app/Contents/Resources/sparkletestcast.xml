<![CDATA[## Version 2.0.1

* Added `markdown` support to release notes.
* Upgraded text kit system to use *improved* TextKit 2.
* Lists in markdown can contain multiple paragraphs

These paragraphs can even span multiple lines if they are long and wide enough to pass over the next line. These paragraphs can also contain useful information.

* Multiple levels of lists can also exist in Markdown
* Indented list items can contain information that are related to a parent list point. For example this could contain information about writing long paragraphs.

1. Markdown also supports numbered lists.
2. This is an example of a numbered list.
    1. Even numbered lists can have multiple levels.
    2. This is an example of numbered lists having multiple levels.

Markdown also allows writing standalone paragraphs that don't belong to any list or other associated element (such as blockquotes). This can be a powerful and normal used feature.

[Writers like markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) because it allows them to blog or write text without having to write all the opening/closing HTML tags. This makes blogging or writing software release notes with markdown a pleasant experience.

From a good friend:

> Markdown is also useful for applications that cannot embed WKWebView directly, such as apps without a download client entitlement, or Catalyst applications.
>
>> In quotes you can also have nested quotes, and the lines in nested quotes can be long enough to span over the next few lines, assuming that the lines are long enough.
>>
>> And that is how nested quotes can work. A known limitation is properly styling lists in blockquotes so I'd suggest to avoid that.
>

After this paragraph, you should see extra spacing from using a line break.

Code blocks from markdown are also supported using a monospace font:

```sh
me@Compy ~/D/P/Sparkle> ls
Autoupdate/          Carthage-dev.json    Configurations/      generate_appcast/    InstallerLauncher/   Package.swift        Sparkle/             TestAppHelper/       Vendor/
bin/                 CHANGELOG            DerivedData/         generate_keys/       InstallerStatus/     README.markdown      sparkle-cli/         TestApplication/
BinaryDelta/         CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md   Documentation/       INSTALL              LICENSE              Resources/           Sparkle.podspec      Tests/
build/               common_cli/          Downloader/          InstallerConnection/ Makefile             sign_update/         Sparkle.xcodeproj/   UITests/
```

Note though, Sparkle's markdown support does not support tables or images. It needs to work without loading additional resources and without switching to TextKit 1.

## Version 2.0

* **Redesigned Interface**: Enjoy a refreshed, modern UI that improves navigation and streamlines workflows across the app.
* **Cloud Sync Support**: Projects and settings can now be synced securely across multiple devices using your account.
* **Customizable Shortcuts**: Create and manage keyboard shortcuts for almost any action.
* Improved launch performance and reduced memory usage during startup.
* Fixed an issue where notifications could appear twice in some cases.
* Addressed several minor visual glitches in dark mode.]]>
